BOT_NAME = "bookscraper"

SPIDER_MODULES = ["bookscraper.spiders"]
NEWSPIDER_MODULE = "bookscraper.spiders"
ITEM_PIPELINES = {
    'bookscraper.pipelines.BookscraperPipeline': 300,
}# To explain this code in detail, ITEM_PIPELINES is a Scrapy setting that allows you to define and configure item pipelines for processing the scraped data. In this case, we are specifying a single pipeline called BookscraperPipeline, which is located in the bookscraper.pipelines module. The number 300 indicates the order in which this pipeline will be executed relative to other pipelines (if any). Lower numbers have higher priority, meaning they will be executed first. By including this line in the settings.py file, we are instructing Scrapy to use the BookscraperPipeline to process the items scraped by our spider, allowing us to perform actions such as cleaning, validating, or storing the data.
